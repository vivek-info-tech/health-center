# **Medicine Recommendation and Pneumonia Detection System**

## **Overview**
The **Medicine Recommendation and Pneumonia Detection System** is an integrated healthcare solution that provides personalized medicine recommendations based on symptoms and predicts pneumonia from X-ray images using deep learning. The project combines a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model for disease prediction and **VGG19** for pneumonia detection, with a user-friendly web interface for interaction.

## **Features**
1. **Medicine Recommendation System**  
   - Predicts diseases based on user-input symptoms using an **SVM model**.
   - Provides personalized suggestions, including:
     - **Medicines** tailored to the predicted disease.
     - **Workout routines** for disease management.
     - **Dietary recommendations** to aid recovery.
     - **Precautionary measures** to prevent disease progression.

2. **Pneumonia Detection**  
   - Uses a **pretrained VGG19 deep learning model** to predict whether an X-ray image indicates pneumonia or not.
   - Classifies images into two categories: **Pneumonia** and **Normal**.

3. **Responsive Web Interface**  
   - Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**.
   - Allows users to:
     - Input symptoms for disease prediction and medicine recommendations.
     - Upload X-ray images for pneumonia detection.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend**: Python, SVM, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Deep Learning**: VGG19 (pretrained model)
- **Libraries/Tools**: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Flask

## **Installation & Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
