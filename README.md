Medicine Recommendation and Pneumonia Detection System
Overview
The Medicine Recommendation and Pneumonia Detection System is an integrated healthcare solution that provides personalized medicine recommendations based on symptoms and predicts pneumonia from X-ray images using deep learning. The project combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for disease prediction and VGG19 for pneumonia detection, with a user-friendly web interface for interaction.

Features
Medicine Recommendation System

Predicts diseases based on user-input symptoms using an SVM model.
Provides personalized suggestions, including:
Medicines tailored to the predicted disease.
Workout routines for disease management.
Dietary recommendations to aid recovery.
Precautionary measures to prevent disease progression.
Pneumonia Detection

Uses a pretrained VGG19 deep learning model to predict whether an X-ray image indicates pneumonia or not.
Classifies images into two categories: Pneumonia and Normal.
Responsive Web Interface

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
Allows users to:
Input symptoms for disease prediction and medicine recommendations.
Upload X-ray images for pneumonia detection.
Technologies Used
Backend: Python, SVM, TensorFlow, Keras
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Deep Learning: VGG19 (pretrained model)
Libraries/Tools: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Flask
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medicine-pneumonia-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd medicine-pneumonia-detection
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The web app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Usage
Medicine Recommendation System:
Input symptoms into the form, and the system will predict the disease and provide personalized recommendations for medicine, workout, diet, and precautions.
Pneumonia Detection:
Upload an X-ray image, and the system will predict whether the image shows signs of pneumonia.
